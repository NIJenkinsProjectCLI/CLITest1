Auto Error Handling Enabled	This VI has Automatic Error Handling enabled. Automatic Error Handling is not advised for released versions of LabVIEW code. Change the setting for this VI in the VI Properties dialog under the Execution tab. You can change the default setting for new VIs in Tools > Options > Block Diagram > Error Handling.
Default Icon	The icon for this VI is either the default icon or blank.
VI Documentation	This VI has no VI Description.
Spell Check	This VI contains the misspelled word "FirstRunTest" in its name.
Comment Usage	This block diagram contains fewer than 1 comment.
Wire Bends	This I32 wire has a segment that is less than the user-specified minimum pixel length (3).
Unused Code	This case structure has a constant wired to the selector.  Consider removing the Case Structure from your diagram since only one of its cases will ever run.
Wired Terminals in Subdiagrams	The control terminal "Array" does not reside on the top-level diagram.   In order to avoid unnecessary memory copies, control and indicator terminals that are wired on the connector pane should be placed on the top-level diagram.
Enabled Debugging	This VI has debugging enabled, which can reduce performance slightly.  Consider disabling debugging in the VI Properties >> Execution dialog box for this VI.
